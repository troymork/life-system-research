# LIFE System 17-Year Simulation Study - Complete Deliverables

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive study successfully completed a 17-year simulation comparing current US socio-economic structures (2025-2030) with LIFE System implementation and global transformation (2030-2042). The study validates the LIFE System as a superior alternative that can scale from pilot programs to 4.6 billion people globally.
