- Node.js 20+ for website development
- A text editor or IDE of your choice

### Repository Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/life-system/research.git
cd research

# Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up website development (if contributing to website)
cd website
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Running Simulations

```bash
# Run individual simulations
python simulations/us_baseline_simulation_2025.py
python simulations/life_system_transformation_simulation.py

# Run comprehensive analysis
python simulations/comprehensive_simulation_analysis.py
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow coding standards and conventions
   - Include appropriate tests and documentation
   - Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality

3. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```
